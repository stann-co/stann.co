              <h3>Creating this website</h3>
              <i>21-10-2025</i>
              <p>
                As part of my new school. One of the early projects we were
                tasked with, was brainstorming, prototyping, testing and finally
                coding a website, around a topic of our own choosing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I immedietly considered making either a personal portfolio
                website or a propper website for my game. But ended up going
                with the latter. Even though it might not be the most important
                right now, i could imagine it might be a useful thing to have in
                the future. Both for potential new fans, as well as maybe
                getting in touch with other developers.
              </p>

                <i>Sketch for <a href="/pengu-lost-and-wanted/gallery/">Gallery page</a></i>
              </p>

              <p>
                I already had a steam page at this point, so i decided to base
                most of the styling on the layout of that, which you'll notice
                if you compare it with the frontpage
              </p>
              <p>
                But apart from just retreading the same ground as my steam page.
                It would also let me flesh out, and write about other aspects of
                the game. This devlog page being one of them. In the early
                stages of my game i had got a lot of help from the
                <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide"
                  >Sonic Physics Guide</a
                >
                on <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/">Sonic Retro.</a> And
                so i'm also taking a lot of inspiration from how their pages are
                set up for this.
              </p>
              <p>
                And lastly i also looked a lot on the
                <a href="https://undertale.com/">Undertale website</a> for style
                inspiration, for the entire page. That game is also just a huge
                inspiration for me and my game in general. and i like how simple
                it's site is.
