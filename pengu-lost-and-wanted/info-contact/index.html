                <i>Last update: October 2025</i>

               <h3>Platforms</h3>
               <h4>PC / Mac / Linux</h4>
               <p>
                The game is currently being developed for PC, and could hopefully be ported to Mac, and linux shortly after
               </p>
               <h4>Consoles</h4>
               <p>I'd love to get it out on all platforms eventually, but y'know, i actually gotta finish the game before i even consider that</p>

               <h3>Release</h3>
               <p>I currently have no clue when the game might be finished <i>sorry.... i really wish i knew....</i></p>
               <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373920/Pengu_Lost_and_Wanted/">demo out on steam,</a> is more of an early prototype of the movement rather than a representation,
                of what im envisioning the final game to be like. And it feels like i only just recently (October 2025)
                Got all of the fundamental systems in place, like the recently added combat. And there's still a few other fundamental elements,
                i unfortunately haven't gotten around to. Though it is in a state where i could start making real levels and story.
                It just takes a while. I am hoping and trying to aim for maybe 2027.
               </p>

               <h3>Languages</h3>
               <p>
                The game will be made first and foremost in English. <br>
                And i have a tiny little dream of maybe getting help
                with translating it to Japanese as well later <i>(if that's you, please reach out!)</i> <br>
               </p>
               <p>
                Other languages being considered are: Danish <i>(cause im danish lol)</i> <br>
                and Russian <i>(a friend who helps with art and concepts is russian)</i>
               </p>
